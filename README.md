A game with very simple graphics that I made in my second term of university for my Computer Programming II class to get used to threads and Java's GUI libraries. Simply compile and run Main.java.
You can control the red square with w,a,s,d keys and left click to shoot. Black squares are your enemies and their fire can kill you and your friends. Green squares are your friends so their fire won't affect you
but they can kill your enemies. Your goal is to survive untill all of your enemies are killed! 
Note: You can change the number of enemies and friends you want from Main to test different difficulties.
